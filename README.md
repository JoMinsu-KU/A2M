# 🤖 LLM-based Industrial Automation Integration Platform

This project integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into industrial automation workflows, allowing users to control manufacturing equipment through natural language commands. The system leverages Asset Administration Shells (AAS), Modbus TCP, and a Streamlit web interface to offer an end-to-end smart manufacturing control environment.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Natural Language Command Execution**: Use LLMs to interpret user instructions and map them to the correct control tools.
- **AAS Integration**: Access and interact with digital twins using Eclipse BaSyx.
- **Real-Time Equipment Control**: Control PLC-connected devices via Modbus TCP.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Web-based GUI for intuitive human-AI interaction.
- **Experimental Toolkit**: Jupyter-based evaluation of model-generated code, tool usage, and system performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set up the Python environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r AI_Agent/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the FastMCP control server

```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

### 3. Launch the Streamlit UI

```bash
cd AI_Agent
streamlit run streamlitChat.py
```

### 4. Start the AAS Server (Docker)

```bash
cd BaSyxMinimal
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📊 Research & Evaluation

The `research_code.ipynb` notebook contains experiments and evaluation tasks related to:
- LangChain-based tool reasoning
- LLM-generated control scripts
- Multi-model evaluation (GPT-4o, Claude 4, Gemini, etc.)
