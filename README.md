# 🤖 A2M: Agent-based Autonomous Manufacturing

This repository implements the system described in the paper  
**"Agent based Autonomous Manufacturing from Planning to Production: Experimental Study on Automatic Tool Generation and Control Using Large-Scale AAS Process Information"**.

It presents a fully functional agent-based autonomous manufacturing pipeline powered by LLMs, AAS, and MCP.

## 📖 Project Summary

A2M is a practical framework that bridges **standardized industrial metadata (AAS)** with **AI planning and control (LLM Agents)**.  
The system:

1. Parses and classifies large-scale AAS files (4,588 total, 1,005 with common operations)
2. Prompts LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Gemma) to generate MCP tools for device control
3. Evaluates tool quality using structured, multi-dimensional criteria
4. Operates end-to-end AFPM motor production based on user natural language commands

> 🔒 Only AAS files related to **AFPM Motor Production** are included publicly.
> The full dataset belongs to **Kyungnam University** and is available upon request.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of A2M,  
connecting the AI Agent, AAS Server, MCP Server, and real manufacturing facility via a local network.

## 🧠 Key Components

### 1. 📁 AAS_Server (BaSyx)

- Based on BaSyxMinimal example
- Provides AAS Registry, Submodel Repo, and Discovery endpoints
- Acts as an **API metadata server** for the AI Agent and FastMCP

### 2. ⚙️ FastMCP_Tools

- Tools automatically generated by LLMs from AAS Operation submodels
- Implements dummy PLC control logic using `pymodbus`
- Controlled via the AI Agent at runtime

### 3. 🤖 AI Agent

- Orchestrates:
  - **Process discovery** via AAS registry
  - **Tool availability check** via FastMCP
  - **Tool invocation** from natural language
- Implements real-time monitoring and parameter mapping

### 4. 📊 Evaluation

- Prompts and scores generated tools across 10 criteria
- Visualization support for heatmaps and comparison tables
- Uses Claude and GPT-based evaluators

## 🧪 Case Study: AFPM Motor Production

- Conducted at ANYTOY Inc. with actual AFPM motor line
- Used Mitsubishi PLC and real AAS-mapped equipment
- Full workflow from `calculate_required_turns()` to `start_manufacturing()` validated

The A2M framework was deployed on a real AFPM motor manufacturing line at ANYTOY Inc.,  
integrating Mitsubishi PLCs, AAS-based tool modeling, and LLM-based orchestration.
