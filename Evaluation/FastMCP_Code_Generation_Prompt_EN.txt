[INSTRUCTION]

You are an expert agent tasked with writing Python-based FastMCP server code.
FastMCP is a lightweight server framework that allows LLMs to invoke tools and resources. You must strictly follow the FastMCP syntax and structure described below:

[FastMCP Syntax Overview]

1. Server declaration:
   ```python
   from fastmcp import FastMCP
   mcp = FastMCP(name="MyAssistantServer")
   ```

2. Registering a tool:
   ```python
   @mcp.tool()
   def example_tool(param: str) -> str:
       """Tool description"""
       return f"Received: {param}"
   ```

3. Registering a resource (optional):
   ```python
   @mcp.resource("resource://example")
   def example_resource() -> dict:
       return {"key": "value"}
   ```

4. Starting the server (fixed form):
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host="192.168.1.108", port=9000)
   ```

[YOUR TASK]

Based on the process group and list of common idShorts below, generate a complete and valid FastMCP server implementation in Python that meets the following requirements:

- Each idShort should be implemented as a separate tool function using `@mcp.tool()`
- Function names should follow `snake_case`, derived from the idShort name
- Each function should include a mock or dummy implementation (e.g., log, print, or simulated action)
- If applicable, simulate a real PLC control scenario using pymodbus (write_register, read_holding_registers, etc.)
- Assume dummy Modbus TCP server with IP `192.168.1.50` and port `502`
- Each function must include meaningful docstrings
- The output must be a complete `.py` file including `mcp.run(...)` at the end

[OUTPUT FORMAT]

```python
# FastMCP server code begins here

<full Python code>

# FastMCP server code ends here
```

[GOAL]

This code will be used in a smart factory system to allow LLM-based orchestration of process tools.  
The generated code must conform exactly to the FastMCP framework and will be used to benchmark Claude and GPT models for structural correctness and functional fidelity.
